     * Given an array containing 0s, 1s and 2s, sort the array in-place. You should treat numbers of the array as
     * objects, hence, we canâ€™t count 0s, 1s, and 2s to recreate the array.
     * <p>
     * The flag of the Netherlands consists of three colors: red, white and blue; and since our input array also
     * consists of three different numbers that is why it is called Dutch National Flag problem.
     * <p>
     * Example 1:
     * <p>
     * Input: [1, 0, 2, 1, 0]
     * Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 2]
     * Example 2:
     * <p>
     * Input: [2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 0]
     * Output: [0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2,]
     * <p>
     * The key was the 3 in problem, "3" types of objects
     * <p>
     * And you know this is gonna be part of a two pointer problem
     * <p>
     * So then you say hey what if I put every zero behind a pointer,
     * and moved it up, every time I put a new 0
     * so now everything behind the first pointer (p1) is 0
     * <p>
     * Then if we do the same thing on the other side except for "2" using another pointer.
     * Using P1 minus P2 we get the length of the array that is still disorganized,
     * so we only have to integrate over that subsection
     * <p>
     * So while iterating, we will move all 0s before low and all 2s after
     * high so that in the end, all 1s will be between low and high.
     * <p>
     * Time: O(N)
     * Space: O(1)
